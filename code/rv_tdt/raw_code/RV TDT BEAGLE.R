#Code I used to fix missing values:


#This is the version of the file that doesn't have missing values
8q24.recode.FILTERED.FILTERED2.recodeMiss.vcf

#BEAGLE can run on the file now, so:

#phase it

#get it into the form needed for RV TDT

#run RV TDT and hopefully get a result back

#put everything in a Markdown
